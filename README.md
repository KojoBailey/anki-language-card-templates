# Anki Language Card Templates
This is a collection of card templates for studying vocabulary in different languages with **sentence cards** on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)!

If you're coming from using vocabulary cards, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/GLfmKWhLhjk) comparing vocabulary to sentence cards. It suggests using a mix of both - vocabulary for concrete nouns and sentences for others - but these templates currently only support sentences. I might modify them to also support single words when no sentence is provided.

## Installation
Anki doesn't keep its templates as simple HTML and CSS files on the filesystem for some reason, but you can copy-and-paste the code manually. It's not much effort anyway.

Alternatively, I've made example decks you can import which will add the cards automatically, which you can get from the Releases page. (coming soon)

If you do want to do it manually or are just curious, these are the fields used in each language's template:
